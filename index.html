   <p>I am a TESOL certified English teacher, gallerist, director of Allpatika Art City project, and art handler at PERROTIN Tokyo. My passion lies on human cognition in general. I also love art, which has become my current job. I am hoping to create
     more opportunities for artists to present their works and viewers have more chance to appreciate and enjoy their works.</p>
